							<h4>Answer:</h4>
							<span class="ans">B</span>
														<h4>Explanation:</h4>
							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Testing is necessary for various reasons, such as:</p><ul><p>To detect defects and failures that may affect the quality, performance, reliability or security of a software product or system</p><p>To verify that a software product or system meets its specified requirements, expectations and standards</p><p>To validate that a software product or system fulfills its intended purpose and satisfies its stakeholders’ needs</p><p>To provide information and feedback about the status and risks of a software product or system</p><p>To comply with regulations or contractual obligations that mandate testing for certain types of software products or systems The following statements describe some reasons why testing is necessary:</p><p>A) The customer decided that 100% branch coverage shall be achieved. This is a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a contractual obligation or a quality standard that requires testing to measure and achieve a certain level of code coverage.</p><p>C) For avionics and pharmaceutical systems software testing is mandated by standards. This is a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a regulation or a compliance requirement that mandates testing for certain types of software products or systems that have high safety or security risks.</p><p>D) The risks associated with delivering the system are far higher than the cost of testing. This is a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a risk-based approach that considers testing as an investment to reduce the probability andimpact of potential failures or defects. The following statement does not describe a reason why testing is necessary:</p><p>B) The acquisition of test automation tools was based on the assumption that it will be used m all projects. This is not a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a business decision or a resource allocation that does not justify the need or purpose of testing. Test automation tools are not always suitable or beneficial for all projects, and testing can be performed with or without test automation tools.

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The ISTQB CTFL syllabus identifies several causes for defects in software. One prominent reason, as highlighted in the curriculum, is the pressure and rush to meet tight deadlines, which can lead to insufficiently reviewed or tested code being moved into further stages of testing or production. This scenario describes rushing to meet a deadline as a potential cause for defects because it may compromise the thoroughness of code development and testing.References:ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Section 1.4.1 "Why is Testing Necessary?".</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">C</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The unscripted tests produced by the tester’s experience during the two-hour test session belong to the testing quadrant Q3. The testing quadrants are a classification of testing types based on two dimensions: the test objectives (whether the testing is focused on supporting the team or critiquing the product) and the test basis (whether the testing is based on the technology or the business). The testing quadrants are labeled as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, and each quadrant represents a different testing perspective, such as unit testing, acceptance testing, usability testing, or performance testing. The testing quadrant Q3 corresponds to the testing types that have the objective of critiquing the product from the business perspective, such as exploratory testing, usability testing, user acceptance testing, alpha testing, beta testing, etc. Theunscripted tests performed by the tester in the given scenario are examples of exploratory testing and usability testing, as they are based on the tester’s experience, intuition, and learning of the web application, and they focus on some specific usability issues, such as the user interface, the user satisfaction, the user feedback, etc. The other options are incorrect, because:</p><ul><p>The testing quadrant Q1 corresponds to the testing types that have the objective of supporting the team from the technology perspective, such as unit testing, component testing, integration testing, system testing, etc. These testing types are usually performed by developers or testers who have access to the source code, the design, the architecture, or the configuration of the software system, and they aim to verify the functionality, the quality, and the reliability of the software system at different levels of integration.</p><p>The testing quadrant Q2 corresponds to the testing types that have the objective of supporting the team from the business perspective, such as functional testing, acceptance testing, story testing, scenario testing, etc. These testing types are usually performed by testers or customers who have access to the requirements, the specifications, the user stories, or the business processes of the software system, and they aim to validate that the software system meets the expectations and the needs of the users and the stakeholders.</p><p>The testing quadrant Q4 corresponds to the testing types that have the objective of critiquing the product from the technology perspective, such as performance testing, security testing, reliability testing, compatibility testing, etc. These testing types are usually performed by testers or specialists who have access to the tools, the metrics, the standards, or the benchmarks of the software system, and they aim to evaluate the non-functional aspects of the software system, such as the efficiency, the security, the reliability, or the compatibility of the software system under different conditions or environments.&nbsp;<b>References</b>: ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 sources and documents:</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 1.3.1, Testing in Software Development Lifecycles</p><p>ISTQB® Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, Testing Quadrant, Exploratory Testing, Usability Testing, Unit Testing, Component Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Functional Testing, Acceptance Testing, Story Testing, Scenario Testing, Performance Testing, Security Testing, Reliability Testing, Compatibility Testing</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The IEEE 829 standard is a widely used specification for test documentation, but it is not mandatory or universal. Most test documentation regimes follow this spec to some degree, with changes done to fit a specific situation or organization. The standard does not require any approval from management, marketing or development for any deviation, nor does it depend on the type of project (military or consumer market). The standard also does not guarantee high quality test documentation regimes, as it only provides a general outline and format, not the actual content or quality criteria.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>An exit criterion is a condition that defines when a test activity has been completed or when a test phase can be concluded. An exit criterion can be based on various factors, such as:</p><ul><p>I) Estimates of defect density or reliability measures. These are quantitative measures that indicate how many defects are present in the software product or how likely it is to fail under certain conditions. These can be used as exit criteria to ensure that the software product meets a certain level of quality or performance before moving to the next phase or releasing it to the customer.</p><p>III) Accuracy measures, such as code coverage, functionality coverage or risk coverage. These are quantitative measures that indicate how much of the software product has been tested in terms of its code, functionality or risk. These can be used as exit criteria to ensure that the test suite is adequate or complete before moving to the next phase or releasing it to the customer.</p><p>IV) Residual risks, such as lack of code coverage in certain areas, unresolved defects or unknown factors. These are qualitative measures that indicate the remaining risks or uncertainties associated with the software product after testing. These can be used as exit criteria to ensure that the residual risks are acceptable or manageable before moving to the next phase or releasing it to the customer. The following factor is not a valid exit criterion:</p><p>II) The completion and publication of an exhaustive Test Report. This is not a valid exit criterion, as it does not reflect the quality or completeness of the testing process or product. A test report is a document that summarizes the results and outcomes of a test activity or phase. A test report can be used as aninput for deciding whether to exit a test activity or phase, but it is not a condition that defines when to exit.

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>&nbsp;State testing techniques are a type of dynamic testing techniques that are based on the behavior of the system under test for different input conditions and events. Dynamic testing techniques require the system to be executed with test cases, whereas static testing techniques do not. Static testing techniques can be applied before the code is ready for execution, such as reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, and static analysis.&nbsp;Static testing techniques can help find defects early in the development process, improve the quality of the code, and reduce the cost and effort of dynamic testing.&nbsp;References&nbsp;= ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 Syllabus, Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1, Page 281; ISTQB Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, Page 292</p></div></span>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>In software testing, risks are categorized into product risks and project risks. Product risks are associated with the potential of a product to fail in meeting its quality criteria. Project risks are related to potential issues that could affect the project's ability to deliver a product.</p><ul><p>[i] is a project risk because it concerns the availability and adequacy of hardware resources for performance testing.</p><p>[ii] is a product risk because it pertains to a security and functionality issue within the web application.</p><p>[iii] is a project risk because it involves the availability of necessary requirements documentation for the testing process.</p><p>[iv] is a product risk because it relates to the system's functionality and data integrity after a failure.</p></ul><p>Thus, statement A correctly classifies [ii] and [iv] as product risks and [i] and [iii] as project risks​​.</p></div></span>

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>A test tool used for the analysis of a developer's code prior to its execution falls under the category of static testing tools. Static testing involves examining the code and documentation without executing the code. These tools are used to perform static analysis, which helps in identifying potential defects and code quality issues early in the development process. The ISTQB CTFL syllabus specifies that static analysis tools are essential for finding defects that do not manifest themselves during the execution of the program.</p><p><b>References:</b>ISTQB CTFL Syllabus, Section 3.1, "Static Testing."</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">C</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The test engineer should re-run the tests, in order to ensure that new defects have not been introduced by the fix. This is also known as regression testing, which is a type of testing that verifies that previously tested software still performs correctly after a change. Regression testing helps to detect any side effects or unintended consequences of a fix or a modification. The other options are incorrect reasons for re-running the tests. The test engineer should not re-run the tests, as they have already been run, and results recorded, because this ignores the possibility of new defects caused by the fix. The test engineer should not re-run the tests, they should be part of the developer tests, because this assumes that developer tests are sufficient and reliable, which may not be true. The test engineer should not re-run the tests, because the defect shows that the test cases need to be updated, because this does not address the impact of the fix on other test cases or functionalities.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>This answer is correct because equivalence partitioning is a test design technique that divides the input domain of a system or component into partitions of equivalent data, such that each partition is expected to produce the same output or behavior. Equivalence partitioning aims to reduce the number of test cases by selecting one representative value from each partition. In this case, the input domain of the TAS can be divided into four partitions based on the bonus rules: less than 50k€, between 50k€ and 80k€, between 80k€ and 120k€, and more than 120k€. The test cases in the answer belong to the same partition, which is between 80k€ and 120k€, and they are expected to produce the same output, which is a bonus of 15%.&nbsp;References: ISTQB Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, ISTQB Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Section 2.3.2.1</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Test-driven development is not an example of a typical generic skill required for testing, but rather an example of a specific technical skill or a development practice that may or may not be relevant for testing, depending on the context and the objectives of the testing activities. Test-driven development is an approach to software development and testing, in which the developers write automated unit tests before writing the source code, and then refactor the code until the tests pass. Test-driven development can help to improve the quality, the design, and the maintainability of the code, as well as to provide fast feedback and guidance for the developers. However, test-drivendevelopment is not a skill that is generally expected or needed for testers, especially for testers who are not involved in unit testing or who do not have access to the source code. The other options are examples of typical generic skills required for testing, which are skills that are applicable and beneficial for testing in any context or situation, regardless of the specific testing techniques, tools, or methods used. The typical generic skills required for testing include:</p><ul><p>Be able to use test management tools and defect tracking tools: These are tools that help testers to plan, organize, monitor, and control the testing activities and resources, as well as to record, track, analyze, and resolve the defects detected during testing. These tools can improve the efficiency, the effectiveness, and the communication of the testing process, as well as to provide traceability, metrics, and reports for the testing outcomes.</p><p>Be able to communicate defects and failures to developers as objectively as possible: This is a skill that involves the ability to report and describe the defects and failures found during testing in a clear, concise, accurate, and unbiased manner, using relevant information, evidence, and terminology, without making assumptions, judgments, or accusations. This skill can facilitate the collaboration, the understanding, and the resolution of the defects and failures between the testers and the developers, as well as to prevent conflicts, misunderstandings, or blame games.</p><p>Possess the necessary social skills that support effective teamwork: These are skills that involve the ability to interact, cooperate, and coordinate with other people involved in or affected by the testing activities, such as the test manager, the test team, the project manager, the developers, the customers, the users, etc. These skills can include communication, negotiation, leadership, motivation, feedback, conflict resolution, etc. These skills can enhance the quality, the productivity, and the satisfaction of the testing process, as well as to foster a positive and constructive testing culture.&nbsp;<b>References</b>: ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 sources and documents:</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 1.1.1, Testing and the Software Development Lifecycle</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 1.1.2, Testing and Quality</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 1.2.1, Testing Principles</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 1.2.2, Testing Policies, Strategies, and Test Approaches</p><p>ISTQB® Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, Test-driven Development, Test ManagementTool, Defect Tracking Tool, Defect Report, Failure, Social Skill2</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">D</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>In maintenance testing, the relationship between impact analysis and regression testing is that the impact analysis is used to evaluate the amount of regression testing to be performed. Maintenance testing is a type of testing that is performed on an existing software product after it has been delivered or deployed, in order to ensure that it still meets its requirements and functions correctly after a change or a modification. Maintenance testing can be triggered by various reasons, such as corrective maintenance (fixing defects), adaptive maintenance (adapting to new environments), perfective maintenance (improving performance), preventive maintenance (avoiding future problems), etc. Impact analysis is a technique that is used to assess the extent and nature of changes introduced by maintenance activities on the software product or project. Impact analysis helps to identify which parts of the software product are affected by the changes, which parts need to be modified or updated accordingly, which parts need to be retested or verified for correctness or compatibility, etc. Regression testing is a type of testing that verifies that previously tested software still performs correctly after a change or a modification. Regression testing helps to detect any side effects or unintended consequences of maintenance activities on the software product’s functionality or quality. Regression testing can be performed at various levels and scopes depending on the impact analysis results. Therefore, in maintenance testing, impact analysis is used to evaluate the amount of regressiontesting to be performed.

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>This answer is correct because it follows the logical dependencies and allows executing the test cases in priority order. TC4, TC3, and TC2 are executed first because they have the highest priority. TC6 is executed next because it has a logical dependency on TC2. TC1 is executed next because it has a logical dependency on TC5. Finally, TC5 is executed last because it has the lowest priority.&nbsp;References: ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 documents</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">C</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><ul><p>Effort estimate does not depend on the budget of the project, but rather on the scope, complexity, and quality of the software product and the testing activities1. Budget is a constraint that may affect the feasibility and accuracy of the effort estimate, but it is not a factor that determines the effort estimate.&nbsp;Effort estimate is the amount of work required to complete the testing activities, measured in terms of person-hours, person-days, or person-months2.</p><p>The other options are correct because:</p><ul><p>A.&nbsp;Once the test effort is estimated, resources can beidentified and a schedule can be drawn up, as they are interrelated aspects of the test planning process3.&nbsp;Resources are the people, tools, equipment, and facilities needed to perform the testing activities4.&nbsp;Schedule is the time frame and sequence of the testing activities, aligned with the project milestones and deadlines5.</p><p>B.&nbsp;Effort estimate can be inaccurate because the quality of the product under tests is not known, as it affects the number and severity of the defects that maybe found and the rework that may be needed to fix them6.&nbsp;Quality is the degree to which the software product satisfies the specified requirements and meets the needs and expectations of the users and clients7.</p><p>D. Experience based estimation is one of the estimation techniques, which relies on the judgment and expertise of the testers and other project stakeholders to estimate the test effort based on similar projects or tasks done in the past. Experience based estimation can be useful when there is a lack of historical data, formal methods, or detailed information about the software product and the testing activities.</p></ul></ul><p>References&nbsp;=</p><ul><p>1&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 154</p><p>2&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 155</p><p>3&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 156</p><p>4&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 157</p><p>5&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 158</p><p>6&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 159</p><p>7&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 16</p><p>[8] ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 160</p><p>[9] ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, 2023, p. 161</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">C</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The figure depicts the life-cycle of a defect using state transition testing. State transition testing is a technique that models how a system transitions from one state to another depending on events or conditions. The figure shows six states (S0 to S5) and seven transitions (T0 to T6). The correct sequence of state transitions that follows the figure is S0-&gt;S1-&gt;S2-&gt;S3-&gt;S5-&gt;S1-&gt;S2-&gt;S3. This sequence represents the following scenario:</p><ul><p>S0: The defect is not yet detected (initial state).</p><p>T0: The defect is detected by testing (event).</p><p>S1: The defect is reported and registered (state).</p><p>T1: The defect is assigned to a developer for fixing (event).</p><p>S2: The defect is being fixed by the developer (state).</p><p>T2: The developer fixes the defect and delivers a new version (event).</p><p>S3: The defect is verified by testing (state).</p><p>T5: The testing fails to confirm that the defect is fixed (event).</p><p>S5: The defect is rejected by testing (state).</p><p>T6: The defect is reassigned to a developer for fixing (event).</p><p>S1: The defect is reported and registered (state).</p><p>T1: The defect is assigned to a developer for fixing (event).</p><p>S2: The defect is being fixed by the developer (state).</p><p>T2: The developer fixes the defect and delivers a new version (event).</p><p>S3: The defect is verified by testing (state). The other sequences are incorrect, as they do not follow the transitions shown in the figure.

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The features of the test object to be tested and those excluded from the testing represent information that is usually included in a test plan and, in the given test plan, it is more likely to be specified within “Test Scope” rather than in the other two sectionsmentioned. The test scope defines the boundaries and limitations of the testing activities, such as the test items, the features to be tested, the features not to be tested, the test objectives, the test environment, the test resources, the test assumptions, the test risks, etc. The test scope helps to establish a common understanding of what is included and excluded from the testing, and to avoid ambiguity, confusion, or misunderstanding among the stakeholders. The other two sections, “Testing Communication” and “Stakeholders”, are also important parts of a test plan, but they do not directly address the features of the test object. The testing communication describes the methods, frequency, and responsibilities for the communication and reporting of the testing progress, status, issues, and results. The stakeholders identify the roles and responsibilities of the people involved in or affected by the testing activities, such as the test manager, the test team, the project manager, the developers, the customers, the users, etc.&nbsp;<b>References</b>: ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 sources and documents:</p><ul><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.1, Test Planning1</p><p>ISTQB® Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, Test Plan, Test Scope2</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">C</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The fact that defects are usually not evenly distributed among the various modules that make up a software application, but rather their distribution tend to reflect the Pareto principle, is expressed by the testing principle referred to as ‘Defects cluster together’. This principle states that a small number of modules contain most of the defects detected, or that a small number of causes are responsible for most of the defects. This principle can be used to guide the test analysis and design activities, by prioritizing thetesting of the most critical or risky modules, or by applying more rigorous test techniques to them. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.</p><p>References: ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.01, Section 1.2.1, page 11; ISTQB® Glossary v4.02, page 16.</p></div></span>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The correct statement is B. According to the ISTQB CTFL syllabus, the testing quadrants help to categorize tests based on their purpose and whether they are technology-facing or business-facing, and whether they support the team or critique the product. Quadrant Q2 includes tests that are business-facing and support the team, such as automated acceptance tests produced during Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)​​ .</p><p>Quadrant Q3 includes business-facing tests that critique the product, such as exploratory testing, usability testing, and user acceptance testing. These tests are typically manual and focus on evaluating the product from a user perspective, rather than being part of a continuous integration process​​.</p><p>Quadrant Q4 includes technology-facing tests that critique the product, such as performance tests, security tests, and other non-functional tests, which can be automated but are not related to unit tests produced during TDD .</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Configuration management is a process that establishes and maintains consistency among work products throughout their life cycle. Configuration management affects testing in various ways, such as:</p><ul><p>Proper configuration management ensures that testers can uniquely identify the tested item, which can help traceability, reproducibility and accountability.</p><p>Proper configuration management ensures that testers have access to consistent versions of software components and testware, which can help reliability, compatibility and efficiency.</p><p>Proper configuration management ensures that testers can track changes and defects in software components and testware, which can help verification, validation and reporting.</p><p>Proper configuration management ensures that testers can control the configuration of the test environment, which can help stability, security and performance. Configuration management is not a prerequisite for test planning, as test planning can proceed without configuration management, although it may be less effective or accurate. Configuration management is not important for developers only, but for testers as well, as it affects the quality and consistency of the testing process and products. Configuration management has a significant influence on the test project, as it affects various aspects of testing, such as traceability, reproducibility, reliability, compatibility, efficiency, verification, validation, reporting, stability, security and performance.

						<div class="myanswer" id="47" style="display: none;">

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>A key characteristic of informal reviews is low cost. Informal reviews are a type of review that does not follow a formal process or have any formal documentation. Informal reviews are usually performed by individuals or small groups of peers or colleagues who have some knowledge or interest in the product under review. Informal reviews can be done at any time and for any purpose, such as checking for errors, clarifying doubts, sharing ideas, etc. Informal reviews have low cost, as they do not require much time, effort, or resources to conduct. The other options are not key characteristics of informal reviews. Kick-off meeting is a characteristic of formal reviews, such as inspections or walkthroughs. Kick-off meeting is a meeting that is held before the review process starts, where the roles and responsibilities of the participants are defined, the objectives and scope of the review are agreed, and the logistics and schedule of the review are planned. Individual preparation is a characteristic of formal reviews, such as inspections or walkthroughs. Individual preparation is an activity that is performed by the reviewers before the review meeting, where they examine the product under review and identify any issues or questions that need to be discussed or resolved during the review meeting. Metrics analysis is a characteristic of formal reviews, such as inspections or walkthroughs. Metrics analysis is an activity that is performed after the review process is completed, where the data and results of the review are collected and analyzed to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the review, as well as to identify any improvement actions or lessons learned forfuture reviews.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>To achieve 100% statement coverage, we need to design test cases that ensure every statement in the given pseudo-code is executed at least once. Analyzing the pseudo-code, we notice that there are conditions based on two variables: Gender and Age. To cover all statements, we need to consider the paths that lead to each assignment of the Shoe Size variable.</p><ul><p>Gender = Boy, Age &lt;= 3 (Shoe Size assignment is not reached, but the condition is evaluated)</p><p>Gender = Boy, Age &gt; 3 AND Age &lt; 5 (Shoe Size = 1)</p><p>Gender = Boy, Age &gt;= 5 AND Age &lt; 7 (Shoe Size = 2)</p><p>Gender != Boy, Age &lt;= 3 (Again, Shoe Size assignment is not reached, but the condition is evaluated)</p><p>Gender != Boy, Age &gt; 3 AND Age &lt; 5 (Shoe Size = 0)</p><p>Gender != Boy, Age &gt;= 5 AND Age &lt; 7 (Shoe Size = 1)</p></ul><p>However, upon closer inspection, we see that tests 1 and 4 do not contribute to statement coverage as they do not lead to a Shoe Size assignment. Therefore, we only need 4 test cases to achieve 100% statement coverage, making option B the correct answer.</p></div></span>

							<span class="ans">C</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Independent testing offers several advantages, such as unbiased testing and detection of different defects. However, a drawback is that an independent test team may be isolated from the development team and project team. This can lead to communication gaps, reduced collaboration, and a lack of understanding of the project context.</p><p>According to the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) syllabus v4.0, an independent test team may not have the same level of understanding of the system as the development team, leading to potential issues in communication and integration​(ISTQB not-for-profit association)​.</p><p>References:</p><ul><p>Certified Tester Foundation Level v4.0</p><p>ISTQB Foundation Level Syllabus 4.0 (2023)</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The test leader is the person who is responsible for planning, monitoring, and controlling the test activities and resources in a test project. The test leader should have the best knowledge of the test objectives, scope, risks, resources, schedule, and quality criteria.&nbsp;The test leader should also be aware of the test automation criteria, such as the execution frequency, the test support, the team education, the roles and responsibilities, and the devs and testers collaboration1. Based on these factors, the test leader can decide which tests are suitable for automation and which are not, and prioritize them accordingly.&nbsp;The test leader can also coordinate with the test automation engineers, the developers, and the stakeholders to ensure the alignment of the test automation strategy with the test project goals and expectations.&nbsp;References&nbsp;= ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 Syllabus, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1, Page 152; ISTQB Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, Page 403; ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 Syllabus, Chapter 6, Section 6.1.1, Page 514; Top 8 Test Automation Criteria You Need To Fulfill - QAMIND1</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Testing is necessary for various reasons, such as:</p><ul><p>To detect defects and failures that may affect the quality, performance, reliability or security of a software product or system</p><p>To verify that a software product or system meets its specified requirements, expectations and standards</p><p>To validate that a software product or system fulfills its intended purpose and satisfies its stakeholders’ needs</p><p>To provide information and feedback about the status and risks of a software product or system</p><p>To comply with regulations or contractual obligations that mandate testing for certain types of software products or systems The following statements describe some reasons why testing is necessary:</p><p>A) The customer decided that 100% branch coverage shall be achieved. This is a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a contractual obligation or a quality standard that requires testing to measure and achieve a certain level of code coverage.</p><p>C) For avionics and pharmaceutical systems software testing is mandated by standards. This is a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a regulation or a compliance requirement that mandates testing for certain types of software products or systems that have high safety or security risks.</p><p>D) The risks associated with delivering the system are far higher than the cost of testing. This is a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a risk-based approach that considers testing as an investment to reduce the probability andimpact of potential failures or defects. The following statement does not describe a reason why testing is necessary:</p><p>B) The acquisition of test automation tools was based on the assumption that it will be used m all projects. This is not a reason why testing is necessary, as it reflects a business decision or a resource allocation that does not justify the need or purpose of testing. Test automation tools are not always suitable or beneficial for all projects, and testing can be performed with or without test automation tools.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">D</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Use cases describe a system's behavior as it responds to a request from a user. They typically consist of various scenarios, such as basic flow, alternative flow, and exceptional flow, which represent possible behaviors when a user interacts with the system. When deriving test cases from use cases, it is important to cover these different types of user behaviors.Test cases should be designed to verify how the system behaves during each of these scenarios. This ensures that the system operates correctly for normal and error conditions encountered by human users or systems interacting with the application. Thus, test cases derived from use cases aim to cover basic, exceptional, and alternative flows, ensuring comprehensive coverage.<b>References:</b></p><ul><p>ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Section 4.2.4.</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Test exit criteria are the conditions that must be fulfilled before concluding a particular testing phase.&nbsp;These criteria act as a checkpoint to assess whether we have achieved the testing objectives and are done with testing1. Test exit criteria are typically defined in the test plan document, which is one of the outputs of the test planning phase. The test plan document describes the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of the testing activities.&nbsp;It also identifies the test items, the features to be tested, the testing tasks, the risks, and the test deliverables2.&nbsp;According to the ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, the test plan document should include the following information related to the test exit criteria3:</p><ul><p>The criteria for evaluating test completion, such as the percentage of test cases executed, the percentage of test coverage achieved, the number and severity of defects found and fixed, the quality and reliability of the software product, and the stakeholder satisfaction.</p><p>The criteria for evaluating test process improvement, such as the adherence to the test strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing activities, the lessons learned and best practices identified, and the recommendations for future improvements.</p></ul><p>Therefore, the test plan document is the most appropriate test document to find the test exit criteria described. The other options, such as test design specification, project plan, and requirements specification, are not directly related to the test exit criteria.&nbsp;The test design specification describes the test cases and test procedures for a specific test level or test type3.&nbsp;The project plan describes the overall objectives, scope, assumptions, risks, and deliverables of the software project4.&nbsp;The requirements specification describes the functional and non-functional requirementsof the software product5.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>A test task that usually occurs during test implementation is to make sure the planned test environment is ready to be delivered. The test environment is the hardware and software configuration on which the tests are executed, and it should be as close as possible to the production environment where the software system will operate. The test environment should be planned, prepared, and verified before the test execution, to ensure that the test conditions, the test data, the test tools, and the test interfaces are available and functional. The other options are not test tasks that usually occur during test implementation, but rather test tasks that occur during other test activities, such as:</p><ul><p>Find, analyze, and remove the causes of the failures highlighted by the tests: This is a test task that usually occurs during test analysis and design, which is the activity of analyzing the test basis, designing the test cases, and identifying the test data. During this activity, the testers can use techniques such as root cause analysis, defect prevention, or defect analysis, to find, analyze, and remove the causes of the failures highlighted by the previous tests, and to prevent or reduce the occurrence of similar failures in the future tests.</p><p>Archive the testware for use in future test projects: This is a test task that usually occurs during test closure, which is the activity of finalizing and reporting the test results, evaluating the test process, and identifying the test improvement actions. During this activity, the testers can archive the testware, which are the test artifacts produced during the testing process, such as the test plan, the test cases, the test data, the test results, the defect reports, etc., for use in future test projects, such as regression testing, maintenance testing, or reuse testing.</p><p>Gather the metrics that are used to guide the test project: This is a test task that usually occurs during test monitoring and control, which is the activity of tracking and reviewing the test progress, status, and quality, and taking corrective actions when necessary. During this activity, the testers can gather the metrics, which are the measurements of the testing process, such as the test coverage, the defect density, the test effort, the test duration, etc., that are used to guide the test project, such as planning, estimating, scheduling, reporting, or improving the testing process.&nbsp;<b>References</b>: ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 sources and documents:</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.1, Test Planning1</p><p>ISTQB®Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.2, Test Monitoring and Control1</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.3, Test Analysis and Design1</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.4, Test Implementation1</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.5, Test Execution1</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabusv4.0, Chapter 2.1.6, Test Closure1</p><p>ISTQB® Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, Test Environment, Test Condition, Test Data, Test Tool, Test Interface, Failure, Root Cause Analysis, Defect Prevention, Defect Analysis, Testware, Regression Testing, Maintenance Testing, Reuse Testing, Test Coverage, Defect Density, TestEffort, Test Duration2</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Static testing, such as code reviews and static analysis, is particularly effective at identifying issues related to code structure and modularization. These techniques allow for the inspection of the code without executing it, making it easier to spot problems related to how the code is organized. Dynamic testing, on the other hand, focuses on the execution of code and is better suited for identifying runtime issues but does not easily reveal structural problems. The ISTQB CTFL Syllabus v4.0 highlights the strengths of static testing in uncovering such structural issue</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">D</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The choice of a software development lifecycle (SDLC) model is primarily influenced by the type of product being developed. Different products and project requirements may demand different SDLC models to address specific challenges and needs efficiently. For instance, a complex, safety-critical product might best be served by a Waterfall model due to its structured nature and phase dependencies, while a more iterative and incremental model might be suited for projects requiring frequent feedback and changes.References:ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Section 2.1 "Software Development Lifecycles".</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are test design techniques that are most appropriate for testing the login page of a web site. The page contains fields for user name and password, which are input values that can be divided into partitions of equivalent data. Equivalence partitioning is a technique that divides the input data and output results of a software component into partitions of equivalent data. Each partition should contain data that is treated in the same way by the component.Equivalence partitioning can be used to reduce the number of test cases by selecting one representative value from each partition. Boundary value analysis is a technique that tests boundary values between partitions of equivalent data. Boundary values are values at the edge of an equivalence partition or at the smallest incremental distance on either side of an edge. Boundary value analysis can be used to detect defects caused by incorrect handling of boundary conditions. For example, for testing the user name field, we can identify two equivalence partitions: valid user name (existing and correct) and invalid user name (non-existing or incorrect). The boundary values for these partitions are the minimum and maximum length of user name allowed by the system.</p><p>Decision table testing and state transition testing are not suitable for testing the login page of a web site, as they are more applicable for testing components that have multiple inputs and outputs that depend on logical combinations of conditions or events. Decision table testing is a technique that shows combinations of inputs and/or stimuli (causes) with their associated outputs and/or actions (effects). State transition testing is a technique that models how a system transitions from one state to another depending on events or conditions.</p><p>Exploratory testing and statement coverage are not suitable for testing the login page of a web site, as they are more applicable for testing components that require learning, creativity and intuition or structural analysis. Exploratory testing is an approach to testing that emphasizes learning, test design and test execution at the same time. Exploratory testing relies on the tester’s skills, creativity and intuition to explore the software under test and discover defects. Statement coverage is a type of structural testing that measures how many statements in a program have been executed by a test suite. Statement coverage can be used to assess the adequacy or completeness of a test suite.</p><p>Decision coverage and fault attack are not suitable for testing the login page of a web site, as they are more applicable for testing components that have complex logic or potential errors. Decision coverage is a type of structural testing that measures how many decision outcomes in a program have been executed by a test suite. Decision coverage can be used to assess the adequacy or completeness of a test suite. Fault attack is a type of functional testing that deliberately introduces faults into a system in order to provoke failures or errors.

						<div class="myanswer" id="66" style="display: none;">

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>&nbsp;If a program got 100% decision coverage in a test, then it is guaranteed that every executable statement is covered. Decision coverage (also known as branch coverage) is a type of structural coverage (also known as white-box coverage) that measures how many decision outcomes have been exercised by a test suite. A decision outcome is a possible result of a decision point (such as an if-then-else statement) in a program’s code. Decision coverage requires that each decision point has both true and false outcomes executed at least once by a test suite. Decision coverage implies statement coverage, which is another type of structural coverage that measures how many executable statements have been executed by a test suite. Statement coverage requires that each executable statement is executed at least once by a test suite. Therefore, if a program got 100% decision coverage in a test, then it also got 100% statement coverage in a test, which means that every executable statement is covered. The other options are not guaranteed to be true if a program got 100% decision coverage in a test. Every output equivalence class has been tested and every input equivalence class has been tested are not guaranteed to be true if a program got 100% decision coverage in a test, because equivalence classes are based on functional requirements or specifications, not on code structure or logic. Equivalence classes are used in specification-based testing (also known as black-box testing), which is a type of testing that does not consider the internal structure or implementation of the system under test. Decision coverage is used in structure-based testing (also known as white-box testing), which is a type of testing that considers the internal structure or implementation of the system under test. Therefore, achieving 100% decision coverage does not imply achieving 100% equivalence class coverage. The “dead” code has not been covered is not guaranteed to be true if a program got 100% decision coverage in a test, because dead code (also known as unreachable code) is code that can never be executed due to logical errors or design flaws. Dead code can reduce readability and maintainability of the code, as well as increasecomplexity and size. Decision coverage does not account for dead code, as it only considers the decision outcomes that are possible to execute. Therefore, achieving 100% decision coverage does not imply that the dead code has not been covered.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>A defect is a flaw in a component or system that can cause the component or system to fail to perform its required function. A defect can cause harm to the end customer, the company, or both, depending on the impact and severity of the failure. In this case, the defect in the code causes the system to lock down accounts that have an overdraft higher than $1000, instead of $10,000. This can cause harm to the end customer, as they may lose access to their funds and face inconvenience or financial difficulties. This can also cause harm to the company, as theymay lose customer trust and satisfaction, face legal issues or complaints, or incur additional costs for fixing the defect and restoring the accounts.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>A new navigation system compared with a previous system is the most suitable application for testing by use cases, because it involves a high level of interaction between the user and the system, and the expected behavior and outcomes of the system are based on the user’s needs and goals. Use cases can help to specify the functional requirements of the new navigation system, such as the ability to enter a destination, select a route, follow the directions, receive alerts, etc. Use cases can also help to compare the accuracy and usability of the new system with the previous system, by defining the success and failure scenarios, the preconditions and postconditions, and the alternative flows of each use case. Use cases can also help to design and execute test cases that cover the main and exceptional paths of each use case, and to verify the satisfaction of the user’s expectations.</p><p>The other options are not the most suitable applications for testing by use cases, because they do not involve a high level of interaction between the user and the system, or the expected behavior and outcomes of the system are not based on the user’s needs and goals. A billing system used to calculate monthly charge based on a large number of subscriber parameters is more suitable for testing by data-driven testing, which is a technique for testing the functionality and performance of a system or component by using a large set of input and output data. The ability of an antivirus package to detect and quarantine a new threat is more suitable for testing by exploratory testing, which is a technique for testing the functionality and security of a system or component by using an informal and flexible approach, based on the tester’s experience and intuition. The suitability and performance of a multimedia (audio video based) system to a new operating system is more suitable for testing by compatibility testing, which is a technique for testing the functionality and performance of a system or component by using different hardware, software, or network environments.&nbsp;<b>References</b>&nbsp;= CTFL 4.0 Syllabus, Section 3.1.1, page 28-29; Section 4.1.1, page 44-45; Section 4.2.1, page 47-48.</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">D</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Statement coverage is a structural coverage metric that measures the percentage of executable statements in the source code that are executed by a test suite1.&nbsp;Decision coverage is another structural coverage metric that measures the percentage of decision outcomes (such as branches or conditions) in the source code that are executed by atest suite1.&nbsp;Decision coverage is a stronger metric than statement coverage,because it requires that every possible outcome of each decision is tested, while statement coverage only requires that every statement is executed at least once2. Therefore, if a test suite achieves 100% decision coverage, it also implies that it achieves 100% statement coverage, because every statement in every branch or condition must have been executed.&nbsp;However, the converse is not true: 100% statement coverage does not guarantee 100% decision coverage, because some branches or conditions may have multiple outcomes that are not tested by the test suite2. For example, consider the following pseudocode:</p><p>if (x &gt; 0) then print(“Positive”) else print(“Non-positive”) end if</p><p>A test suite that executes this code with x = 1 and x = -1 will achieve 100% statement coverage, because both print statements are executed. However, it will not achieve 100% decision coverage, because the condition x &gt; 0 has only been tested with two outcomes: true and false. The third possible outcome, x = 0, has not been tested by the test suite. Therefore, the test suite may miss a potential bug or error in the condition or the branch.</p><p>The other options, such as stale transition coverage, equivalence class coverage, and boundary value coverage, are not guaranteed to be 100% by achieving 100% decision coverage.&nbsp;Stale transition coverage is a structural coverage metric that measures the percentage oftransitions between states in a state machine that are executed by a test suite3.&nbsp;Equivalence class coverage is a functional coverage metric that measures the percentage of equivalence classes (or partitions) of input or output values that are tested by a test suite4.&nbsp;Boundary value coverage is another functional coverage metric that measures the percentage of boundary values (or extreme values) of input or outputranges that are tested by a test suite4. These metrics are independent of decision coverage, because they are based on different aspects of the system under test, such as its behavior, functionality, or specification. Therefore, achieving 100% decision coverage does not imply achieving 100% of any of these metrics, and vice versa.&nbsp;References&nbsp;=&nbsp;ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0,&nbsp;Test Coverage in Software Testing - Guru99,&nbsp;Structural Coverage Metrics - MATLAB &amp; Simulink - MathWorks India,&nbsp;Test Design Coverage in Software Testing - GeeksforGeeks.</p></div></span>

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>In the given code snippet, the premium is increased by 1500 if the age is less than 30.

						<div class="myanswer" id="76" style="display: none;">

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Testware is a term that refers to all artifacts produced during the testing process, such as test plans, test cases, test scripts, test data, test results, defect reports, etc. The following statements about testware are correct:</p><ul><p>II) All the testware should be subject to Configuration Management. Configuration management is a process that establishes and maintains consistency among work products throughout their life cycle. Configuration management applies to all testware, as it helps ensure their quality and consistency, track their changes and defects, control their versions and access rights, and link them to other artifacts.</p><p>III) The testware at the end of the project should be transferred to the organization responsible for maintenance. Maintenance testing is testing performed on a software product after delivery to correct defects or improve performance or other attributes. Maintenance testing requires testware from previous testing activities or phases, such as test cases, test data, test results, etc. Therefore, the testware at the end of the project should be transferred to theorganization responsible for maintenance testing, such as support team or maintenance team. The following statements about testware are incorrect:</p><p>I) When closing the test activities, all the testware resources can be uninstalled and released. This statement is incorrect, as some testware resources may still be needed for future testing activities or phases, such as maintenance testing or regression testing. Therefore, when closing the test activities, some testware resources should be archived and stored for future use, while others can be uninstalled and released.</p><p>IV) The developers are responsible for the correct installation of the testware. This statement is incorrect, as the testers are responsible for the correct installation of the testware. The testers should ensure that they have access to all necessary testware resources and that they are installed and configured properly before starting the test execution.

						<div class="myanswer" id="81" style="display: none;">

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Covering all transitions at least once is the highest coverage criterion for state transition based test cases, because it ensures that every possible change of state is tested at least once. This means that all the events that trigger the transitions, as well as the actions and outputs that result from the transitions, are verified. Covering all transitions at least once also implies covering all states at least once, but not vice versa. Therefore, option D is not the highest coverage criterion. Option C is the lowest coverage criterion, because it only tests the initial and final states of the system or component, without checking the intermediate states or transitions. Option A is incorrect, because the coverage criteria for state transition based test cases can be determined and compared based on the number of transitions and states covered.&nbsp;References&nbsp;= CTFL 4.0 Syllabus, Section 4.2.3, page 49-50.</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The requirement specifies that a bonus should be paid if the total amount of sales (TAS) made during the year is 300,000€ or more. The software incorrectly implements this requirement with "IF (TAS = 300,000)" instead of "IF (TAS &gt;= 300,000)". Using boundary value analysis (BVA), which is a common technique in software testing, the three test cases provided (TC1 = 299,999, TC2 = 300,000, and TC3 = 300,001) cover the critical boundary values around the condition.</p><ul><p>TC1 tests just below the boundary (299,999),</p><p>TC2 tests exactly at the boundary (300,000),</p><p>TC3 tests just above the boundary (300,001).</p></ul><p>Since the software incorrectly checks for TAS equal to 300,000, only TC2 will fail because the condition is exactly met and highlights the incorrect implementation of the decision logic.</p></div><div class="reference">[Reference: ISTQB CTFL Syllabus V4.0, Chapter 4.2.2, Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)​​., , ]</div></span>

						<div class="myanswer" id="86" style="display: none;">

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Traceability primarily refers to the ability to link test cases back to their sources in the test basis, such as requirements or design documents. This linkage allows for the determination of coverage, impact analysis, and maintaining consistency across test documentation. However, traceability does not directly enable the application of experience-based test techniques, which are more about using the tester's intuition and experience. The ISTQB CTFL Syllabus v4.0 does not state that traceability enables experience-based techniques, making option B the false statement​​.</p></div></span>

							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Component integration tests are designed to verify the interactions and interfaces between integrated components. These tests should be carried out after component testing (where individual components are tested in isolation) but before system testing (where the entire system is tested as a whole). This ensures that any issues arising from the integration of components are identified and resolved early in the testing process, making option D the correct answer​​.</p></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>The test manager is most likely following the V-model for software development. The V-model is a software development model that defines four testing levels that correspond to four development phases: component testing corresponds to component design, integration testing corresponds to architectural design, system testing corresponds to system requirements specification, and acceptance testing corresponds to user requirements specification. The V-model also defines the test planning and test execution activities for each testing level. Agile is a software development model that follows an iterative and incremental approach, where testing is integrated into each iteration and adapts to changing requirements and feedback. Waterfall is a software development model that follows a sequential and linear approach, where testing is performed after the development phase is completed. Prototyping is a softwaredevelopment model that involves creating a simplified version of the software to elicit user feedback and validate requirements before developing the final product.

They are often written in different formats, such as rule-oriented, scenario-oriented, or table-oriented, depending on the nature and complexity of the user story. They represent an aspect of a user story referred to as confirmation, which is one of theso called “3 C’s” of user stories. The other two aspects are card and conversation. Card refers to the concise and informal description of the user story, usually following the template: “As a [role], I want [feature], so that I can [benefit]”. Conversation refers to the ongoing dialogue between the stakeholders and the team members to clarify and refine the user story and its acceptance criteria.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">C</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Traceability is the ability to trace the relationships between the items of the test basis, such as the requirements, the design, the risks, etc., and the test artifacts, such as the test cases, the test results, the defects, etc. Traceability can provide various benefits for the testing process, such as improving the test coverage, the test quality, the test efficiency, and the test communication. However, not all the statements given are true about the value of maintaining traceability between the test basis and test work products. The statement that is not true is option C, which says that test objectives should be the same for all test levels, although the number of tests designed at various levels can vary significantly. This statement is false, because test objectives are the goals or the purposes of testing, which can vary depending on the test level, the test type, the test technique, the test environment, the test stakeholder, etc. Test objectives can be defined in terms of the test basis, the test coverage, the test quality, the test risk, the test cost, the test time, etc. Test objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, and they should be aligned with the project objectives and the quality characteristics. Test objectives should not be the same for all test levels, as different test levels have different focuses, scopes, and perspectives of testing, such as component testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. The other statements are true about the value of maintaining traceability between the test basis and test work products, such as:</p><ul><p>Traceability can be useful for assessing the impact of a change to a test basis item on the corresponding tests: This statement is true, because traceability can help to identify which tests are affected by a change in the test basis, such as a new requirement, a modified design, a revised risk, etc., and to determine the necessary actions to update, re-execute, or re-evaluate the tests. Traceability can also help to estimate the effort, the cost, and the time needed to implement the change and to verify its impact on the software system.</p><p>Traceability can be useful for determining how many test basis items are covered by the corresponding tests: This statement is true, because traceability can help to measure the test coverage, which is the degree to which the test basis is exercised by the test cases. Traceability can help to identify which test basis items are covered, partially covered, or not covered by the tests, and to evaluate the adequacy, the completeness, and the effectiveness of the testing process. Traceability can also help to identify the gaps, the overlaps, or the redundancies in the test coverage, and to prioritize, optimize, or improve the test cases.</p><p>Traceability can be useful to support the needs required by the auditing of testing: This statement is true, because traceability can help to provide evidence, documentation, and justification for the testing activities, results, and outcomes. Traceability can help to demonstrate that the testing process follows the standards, the regulations, the policies, and the best practices that are applicable to the software system, the project, or the organization. Traceability can also help to verify that the testing process meets the expectations, the needs, and the satisfaction of the users and the stakeholders.&nbsp;<b>References</b>: ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 sources and documents:</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 1.2.2, Testing Policies, Strategies, and Test Approaches1</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.1, Test Planning1</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.2, Test Monitoring and Control1</p><p>ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0, Chapter 2.1.3, Test Analysis and Design1</p><p>ISTQB® Glossary of Testing Terms v4.0, Traceability, Test Basis, Test Artifact, Test Objective, Test Level, Test Coverage, Test Quality, Test Risk, Test Cost, Test Time2</p></ul></div></span>

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">A</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>Test exit criteria are the conditions or requirements that must be met before testing can be concluded. Test exit criteria are usually defined in the test plan and agreed by the stakeholders. Test exit criteria can be based on various factors, such as test coverage, defect status, quality level, risk level, etc. Test schedules would be the least likely to be used as the basis for test exit criteria, because test schedules are not directly related to the quality or performance of the software product, but rather to the time or resources allocated for testing. Test schedules can be used as the basis for test entry criteria, which are the conditions or requirements that must be met before testing can start. The other options are more likely to be used as the basis for test exit criteria. Cost of testing performed so far can be used as a basis for test exit criteria, because it can indicate the return on investment or the cost-benefit ratio of testing. Confidence of testers in tested code can be used as a basis for test exit criteria, because it can reflect the level of satisfaction or assurance of the testers about the quality or reliability of the software product. Number of unfixed defects can be used as a basis for test exit criteria, because it can indicate the level of risk or impact of the remaining defects on the software product.

							<h4>Answer:</h4>

							<span class="ans">B</span>

					

							
							<h4>Explanation:</h4>

							<span><div class="explanation"><p>An incident report is a document that records the details of an incident. An incident report typically contains the following items:</p><ul><p>Identifier: A unique identifier for the incident report</p><p>Summary: A concise summary of the incident</p><p>Description: A detailed description of the incident, including the steps to reproduce it, the expected and actual results, and any relevant screenshots or logs</p><p>Severity: The degree of impact that the incident has on the system</p><p>Priority: The level of urgency for resolving the incident</p><p>Status: The current state of the incident, such as new, open, resolved, closed, etc.</p><p>Resolution: The action taken to resolve the incident, such as fix, workaround, reject, etc. Based on the information given in the question, the tester would be able to write down all of these items except for the test case identifier. A test case identifier is a unique identifier for a test case that is used to link it to other test artifacts, such as test plans, test scripts, test results or incident reports. However, since the tester is performing exploratory testing, there is no predefined test case that can be associated with the incident. Exploratory testing is an approach to testing that emphasizes learning, test design and test execution at the same time. Exploratory testing relies on the tester’s skills, creativity and intuition to explore the software under test and discover defects. Exploratory testing does not use formal test cases or scripts, but rather uses test charters or missions that guide the tester’s actions and objectives.
